# Close Spoitify Tab
A simple extension that will close a spotify tab after you've been redirected to 
the app. 

### Funcitonality
On loading an 'open.spotify.com' page, the extension will wait 5 seconds, then 
check that the user was referred by the same page, and if the user has provided 
any mouse input. If not, the page is closed. That's it !!

## Installation 
This extension is available for Firefox, [you can get it here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/closespotifytab/)
